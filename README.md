# Databases-Project

<b/>Design and implementation of a database for a Hotel Management System.</b>

The project aims to develop a comprehensive information management system designed specifically for hotels to efficiently manage various aspects of their operations. Functionalities will include reservations management, guest check-in/check-out, room assignment, food service and housekeeping, billing and reporting.

<b/>Description of the problem:</b>

The problem to be solved is that of a hotel which faces challenges in the efficient management of reservations, guest check-in/check-out, room assignment, and tracking of services and payments. Currently, it relies heavily on manual processes and stand-alone systems that lead to errors, data duplication and delays in customer service. The lack of integration between existing systems hinders coordination between departments and limits the ability to generate accurate and timely reports. An automated hotel management system is necessary to improve operational efficiency, provide a smoother guest experience and facilitate data-driven decision making.

<b/>Functional Requirements of the Database System:</b>

• Reservation Management: Allow users to make online reservations, modify and cancel existing reservations.

• Room Management: Facilitate room assignment based on availability and guest preferences.

• Check-in/Check-out: Automate the guest check-in and check-out process, including the generation of room keys.

• Billing: Calculate and record guest charges for services used and hotel stay.

• Reporting: Provide detailed reports on occupancy, revenue, and guest satisfaction.

<b/>Non-Functional Database System Requirements:</b>

• Security: Ensure the protection of sensitive guest data and the integrity of stored information.

• Scalability: Ability to handle future growth in data and user volume.

• Usability: Intuitive and easy to use interface for hotel employees.

• Integration: Compatibility and ability to integrate with third-party systems such as reservation platforms and payment management systems.
